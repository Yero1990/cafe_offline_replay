# Header Definitions: 
# target       : target name analyzed 
# kin          : kinematics analyzed  
# beam_time    : beam-on-target time [s] 
# avg_current  : average beam current [uA] 
# total_charge : cumulative charge (over all runs) [mC] 
# yield        : yield (counts integrated over Pm) with all data-analysis cuts applied 
# yield_eff    : yield corrected for inefficiencies (hms/shms tracking + live_time) 
# yield_corr   : yield_eff corrected for external/internal impurities, if any 
# sigma_raw_per_nucleon   : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density(g/cm2) (per nucleon))
# sigma_raw_per_nucleus   : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density (per nucleus) e.g xA )
# sigma_raw_per_proton    : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density (per proton) e.g. xA/Z )
# tgt_thick: target density (g/cm2)
# T N Z A    : transparency (T) # of neutrons (N) protons(Z) and nucleons (A)
