# Header Definitions: 
# target       : target name analyzed 
# kin          : kinematics analyzed  
# beam_time    : beam-on-target time [s] 
# avg_current  : average beam current [uA] 
# total_charge : cumulative charge (over all runs) [mC] 
# yield        : yield (raw counts integrated over Pm) with all data-analysis cuts applied 
# yield_eff    : yield corrected for inefficiencies (hms/shms tracking + live_time + proton absorption) 
# yield_corr   : yield_eff corrected for external/internal impurities if any 
# rad_corr     : radiative correction factor, yield_rad / yield_norad (to be applied when calculating ratios) 
# sigma_raw_per_nucleon   : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density(g/cm2) (per nucleon))
# sigma_raw_per_proton    : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density (per proton) e.g. xA/Z )
# sigma_raw_per_nucleus   : corrected yield (yield_corr) normalized by (total_charge|transpacency|area_density (per nucleus) e.g xA )
# stat_rel_err            : relative statistical error on the total yield calculated as sqrt(yield)/yield 
# norm_syst_rel_err       : relative systematic error due to normalization correction factors (hms/shms track efficiencies, live time, proton transmission, ca40,48 cntm) 
# tgt_thick               : target density (g/cm2)
# T N Z A                 : transparency (T) # of neutrons (N) protons(Z) and nucleons (A)
