# Brief: This shell script runs the analyzer on raw replayed
#        .root files (leafs/branches) and outputs .root files
#        containing histogram objects as well as an output .txt
#        file containing a summary of the run and cuts applied. 
#        The user has the option to set/modify analysis cuts,
#        and histogram binning via an external .txt file, as well
#        as applying a scale factor to the data weight for charge
#        normalization, and efficiency corretions, e.g. scale = 1 / (charge * track_eff * live_time *  . . . )
#        By scaling the data by these correction factors, one will be able
#        to make direct comparisons with simulation, as simulation assumes 100% efficiency,
#        and 1 mC of charge.


# Which analysis type are we doing? "data" or "simc" or "systematics"
# User will need to make symlink of the original file (analyze_cafe.sh) to (analyze_cafe_ana_type.sh), where ana_type="simc" or "data"
