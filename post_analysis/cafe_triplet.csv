# CaFe Triplet Numerical Ratios (pass4) 
# 
# Header Definitions: 
# target       : target A used in single ratio 
# singleR_A_ca48_mf   : single ratio of target A_MF / Ca48_MF (per proton) 
# singleR_A_ca48_src  : single ratio of target A_SRC / Ca48_SRC (per proton) 
# doubleR      : double ratio of target A(SRC/MF) relative to Ca48 (SRC/MF) 
# _stat_err    : absolute statistical uncertainty 
# _norm_syst_err : absolute systematic error due to normalization correction factors (a) hms/shms track efficiencies (b) live time (c) proton transmission (d) ca 40/48 cntm)
# _RC_syst_err   : absolute systematic error due to radiative corrections 
# _cut_syst_err  : absolute systematic error due to cut sensitivity 
# _syst_err      : absolute systematic errors added in quadrature
# _tot_err       : absolute total errors (statistical + systematics added in quadrature) 
# N: Z: A      : # of neutrons (N): protons(Z): nucleons (A): for target A 
# NoZ          : N/Z 
# NmZoA        : (N-Z)/A
