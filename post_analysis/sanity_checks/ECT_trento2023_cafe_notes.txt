SRC Workshop Trento July 2023 NOTES
------------------------------------

From CaFe presentations /  discussion with Dien, the following ideas
and thoughts were born:

------------
Hypothesis:
------------
A: Be9, B10, B11, C12, Ca40, Ca48, Fe54(data), 56(simc), Aug197

The relative drop in A/C12 vs. A @ MF kinematics can be
attributed to an acceptance effect in the Hall C spectrometers.

If we compare DATA and SIMC A/C12 vs. A @ MF kinematics, we noticed,
that DATA-to-SIMC did not quite agree, however, upon applying the
proper spectral function acceptance corrections to SIMC, brings the
SIMC in good agreement with DATA. Now both DATA and SIMC are
in good agreement for A/C12 @ MF, and show a similar linear drop-off
with mass number. This indicates that there is an acceptance effect
associated with this loss in strength. For example, the missing energy (Em)
and missing momentum (Pm) might be limited due to finite spectrometer
acceptance and causing a loss in strength of spectral function.

Now, for the A/C12 @ SRC kinematics, we currently see a ration of ~1, which
is contrary to the expected scaling behavior that should be observed. This, too,
may be also due to spectrometer acceptance effects, in which case, one would need
to determine how to calculate the spectral correction factor for high-p nucleons (SRC)
for which one would require knowledge of the spectral functions S(Em,Pm) @ high momentum
and those are not trivial to obtain

------------------------
Alternative suggestion:
------------------------
Assuming our observations of the odd behavior of single ratios of A/C12 @ MF, SRC is due to spectrometer
acceptance limitations: rather than trying to find correction factor for acceptance-dependent effects,
if one takes a double ratio:  A_SRC/A_MF / (C12_SRC/C12_MF), one may remove this spectrometer acceptance
effects and get ultimately a good agreement between data and theory calculations or models.
For example, Justins Estees / Andrew Denniston model, correctly describes, or rather, seems to be in
relatively good agreement if we both use the double ratios, which could be indication that acceptance
effects cancel for our data, leading to the good agreement.  However, if one looks a the single ratios,
there is a completely different behavior between A/C12 for data and the model.

It would be interesting, to check, if possible, is the model can be cut off in Emiss and Pmiss, to check its
behavior, whether it is similar to data. Something to ask Justin/Andrew.



--------------------------------------
What is spectral function correction? 
--------------------------------------
The spectral function, S(Em,Pm) is a function that relates
the probability of finding a nucleon with (Em, Pm), where Em
and Pm, in theory, are integrated over the full range. However,
when the S(Em, Pm) is passed through a finite detector/spectrometer
acceptance, this limites the (Em, Pm) range, and can cause the S(Em,Pm)
to be weaker, leading to a decrease in the yield. The thesis
by D.McKafe Oneill (1994), goes over a method to find the correction factor
based on Emiss and Pmiss cuts placed on the data, compared to the fully integrated
spectral function. See Tables 11 (p.122) and 12 (p.126)

Correl_factor = 1 / Icorrel * integral_[R] { dEm * d^3p * S(Em, pm)  },
-->  where R is the integration range of (Em,Pm) for DATA.

Icorrel = 1/2 * ( integral_[R] {dEm * d^3p * S(Em,Pm)}  + integral_[0, inf] {dEm} * integral_[pm_min, pm_max]{d^3p * S(Em,Pm)}  )

Now, there were discussions that arose during the SRC Workshop @ Trento (ECT), of whether these correction from this thesis
should be or not implemented, and whether there are other opinions on what the correction factors should be, etc.  This
needs to be followed-up with theorists, to try and figure out the best approach
