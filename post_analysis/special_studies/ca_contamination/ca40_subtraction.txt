Dear Folks,

According to my records, Ca48 is 90.5% pure.
I assume that the remainder is Ca40.  The 48Ca target is 1051 mg/cm2.
If the purity refers to number of atoms, then the purity by weight is 91.5%.
(We need to find out whether purity refers to mass or to number.)  

Thus there is (1 - 0.915 * 1051) = 89 mg/cm^2 of Ca40 in the Ca48 target.
THe Ca40 target is 785 mg/cm^2

Ca48_corr = Ca48 - (89 / 785) * Ca40
where Ca48 is the Ca48 yield per charge and Ca40 is the Ca40 yield per charge.  
This is true for both MF and for SRC.
The corrected target thickness is 1051 - 89 = 962 mg/cm^2.  (My spreadsheet has a minor error in this number.)
