Carlos' Notes of Sanity Checks

Jun 25, 2023:
--------------
While comparing Data/SIMC Emiss, I noticed C12 Emiss was offset
I compared Au197 Emiss Data/SIMC and they were fine. Then upon
checking the C12 MF Emiss distribution from two independent runs
taken (16977 and 17098), I noticed the two data Emiss were
offset from each other.  I decided to compare as a test, the two
Be9 MF Emiss taken (16983, 17100) and they were not as offset as
C12, but negligible offset.  This needs to be further explored.
Perhaps compare independent C12 MF runs to C12 MF SIMC and check which
Emiss better agrees, for example.

Nevertheless,  the Pmx,y,z Pm components seemed fine, so Im not
sure why was Emiss offset.
